## INSIGHTS 

### Sales by Product Category
* Skincare is the most popular and profitable product type, accounting for 45% of sales.
* Cosmetics are the second most popular product type, accounting for 25.5% of sales.
* Haircare is the least popular product type, accounting for 29.5% of sales.
### Relationship Between Price and Revenue Generated
* The relationship between price and revenue generated is not linear. There is a point where the revenue generated starts to decrease significantly as the price increases. This is known as the price point of diminishing returns.
* The slope of the line graph is different for each product type. This suggests that the relationship between price and revenue generated is different for different product types.
* There is a gap between the revenue generated by skincare products and the other two product types. This suggests that skincare products are in high demand and that there is an opportunity for other product types to increase their market share.
### Revenue Generated by Shipping Carriers
* Carrier B is the company's primary shipping carrier, accounting for the highest revenue.
* Carrier C and Carrier A are also used by the company, but to a lesser extent.
* This is likely due to Carrier B's large network of distribution centers, fast and reliable shipping services, and competitive shipping rates.
### Cost of Distribution by Mode of Transportation
* Road transportation is the most expensive mode of transportation, accounting for 28.7% of the total cost.
* Rail transportation is the second most expensive mode of transportation, accounting for 30.3% of the total cost.
* Air transportation is the third most expensive mode of transportation, accounting for 13.4% of the total cost.
* Sea transportation is the least expensive mode of transportation, accounting for 27.6% of the total cost.
### Rate of Defects by Product Type
* The overall defect rate is relatively low, at 2.5%. This suggests that companies are doing a good job of manufacturing high-quality products.
* However, there is some variation in the defect rate by product type. Skincare products have the lowest defect rate, followed by haircare products and then cosmetics products. This may be due to the fact that skincare products are often subject to more rigorous quality control standards than cosmetics products. Additionally, skincare products may contain more expensive and delicate ingredients that require more care in manufacturing and handling.
* The defect rate can vary over time due to a number of factors, such as changes in production processes, the introduction of new products and changes in the quality of raw materials.
* Companies should continue to monitor the defect rate of their products and take steps to reduce defects whenever possible. By doing so, they can improve the quality of their products and increase customer satisfaction.
### Rate of Defects by Mode of Transportation
* Road transportation has the highest rate of defects (28.9%), followed by rail transportation with air transportation each at (25.5%) respectfully and sea transportation (20.1%).
* This suggests that road transportation is the riskiest mode of transportation for goods with over a quarter of all goods being damaged or lost in transit.
* Rail transportation and Sea transportation are also relatively risky modes of transportation with over one in five goods being damaged or lost in transit.
* Air transportation is the safest mode of transportation with less than one in five goods being damaged or lost in transit.
* The higher rate of defects for road,rail and sea transportation may be due to the fact that these modes of transportation involve more handling and jostling of goods.
